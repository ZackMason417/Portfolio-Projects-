# BMI Calculator

A simple BMI (Body Mass Index) calculator application implemented in Python. Users can input their weight and height, and the program calculates and displays their BMI along with a classification.

This Python project is a BMI calculator inspired by the YouTube tutorial by [Alex The Analyst](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ey1VNjU0YbM&list=PLUaB-1hjhk8FE_XZ87vPPSfHqb6OcM0cF&index=52).

## Project Overview

The BMI calculator takes user input for weight and height and then calculates the Body Mass Index (BMI). It also provides a classification based on the calculated BMI.

## Features

- Input user's name, weight in kilograms, and height in meters.
- Calculate BMI using the formula: BMI = weight / (height^2).
- Classify BMI into categories such as Underweight, Normal Weight, Overweight, Obese, Severely Obese, and Morbidly Obese.
- Display the user's name, weight, height, calculated BMI, and classification.

## Usage

Enter your name, weight in kilograms, and height in meters as prompted.

The program will calculate your BMI and provide a classification based on the calculated value.

Example

Suppose a user inputs the following:

Name: John
Weight: 70 kg
Height: 1.75 m
The program will output:

makefile
