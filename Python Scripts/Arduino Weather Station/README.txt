Arduino Weather Station with ThingSpeak Integration
This project is an Arduino-based weather station that collects temperature, humidity, and pressure data using an Arduino board with an MKRIoTCarrier and sends this data to ThingSpeak for real-time monitoring and visualization. This allows you to monitor weather conditions remotely.

Features
Real-time Weather Data: The weather station collects temperature, humidity, and pressure data.
ThingSpeak Integration: Sends the data to ThingSpeak for real-time monitoring and visualization.
Components Used
Arduino MKR WiFi 1010 with MKRIoTCarrier (Integrated DHT Sensor for temperature and humidity, BMP280 Sensor for pressure)
WiFi Connection for Internet Connectivity
Installation
Arduino Setup:

Upload the provided Arduino sketch (weather_station.ino) to your Arduino board.
ThingSpeak Setup:

Create a ThingSpeak account at ThingSpeak.com.
Create a new channel and note the Channel ID and Write API Key.
Python Script Setup:

Install the required Python libraries:
bash
Copy code
pip install pyserial
Modify the weather_station_data.py script with your ThingSpeak Channel ID and Write API Key.
Run the Python Script:

Execute the Python script weather_station_data.py to start collecting and sending data to ThingSpeak.
Visualization:

Access your ThingSpeak channel to visualize the live weather data.
Usage
Power on the Arduino Weather Station.
Monitor the serial monitor for real-time data readings.
Access your ThingSpeak channel to view live weather data.
Future Upgrades (Possible Additions)
MySQL Database Integration: Store the collected data in a MySQL database for historical analysis.
Additional Sensors: Explore adding more sensors for advanced weather monitoring.
Display Interface: Incorporate an LCD display for local data visualization.
